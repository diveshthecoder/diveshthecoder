#### 🗳️ Voting System
📚 A mini-project developed as part of the **Advanced Database** course.  
This project is divided into two repositories:

- 🔹 [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/diveshthecoder/voting-system-frontend) — Built using **React** and **TypeScript**

🧑‍💻 **My Contributions:**

- Designed and managed the **database schema** for user and vote storage  
- Wrote **project documentation** and helped with testing & deployment

🚀 Goal: To create a secure and efficient online voting platform demonstrating advanced database concepts.
